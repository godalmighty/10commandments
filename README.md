The 10 commandments I gave to Moses

* You shall have no other Gods but me.
* You shall not make for yourself any idol, nor bow down to it or worship it.
* You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.
* You shall remember and keep the Sabbath day holy.
* Respect your father and mother.
* You must not kill.
* You must not commit adultery.
* You must not steal.
* You must not give false evidence against your neighbour.
*You must not be envious of your neighbour's goods. You shall not be envious of his house nor his wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbour.
